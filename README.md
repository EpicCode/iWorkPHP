Welcome to iWorkPHP a simple and powerful web framework, with the aim of facilitating the development, making it more intelligent, intuitive and fun. <br/>
With iWorkPHP, you no longer lose valuable time learning to use complex standards, so you can now just focus on your business.

Installation
-------------------------------

### Standart Edition

The recommended way to create a new project is to use [Composer][1].

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new iWorkPHP application:

    composer create-project -s dev iworkphp/framework-standard-edition path/to/install

Composer will install iWorkPHP and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.
